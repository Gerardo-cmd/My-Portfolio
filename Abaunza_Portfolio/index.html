                    <p id = "info-me">I am a rising senior Computer Science student at George Mason University. 
                        It is there that I learned Java, Python, and C as well as various other topics such as data structures and formal methods and logic. 
                        Additionally, I am self taught in Javascript, HTML, CSS and am currently learning Node.js on my own. I have coded for over two years now and love the challenge. 
                        I currently reside in Centreville, Virginia and am currently looking to intern remotely or anywhere in the Northern Virginia and DC Metropolitan Area as a front-end developer
                        or software engineer!

                        <p>This is the traditional hangman game. It will fetch a random two words from an API and will return the words as asteriks 
                            so that the user can guess letter by letter and eventually, the words. 
                            If the user guesses a correct letter then the letter will show up in place of the asterik in every occurence of it in both of the words. 
                            If the user makes an incorrect guess then the number of guesses the user has left will decrease by one.
    
                            The user wins the game by either figuring out the word within the alloted number of guesses or fails the game by running out 
                            of guesses without guessing the words. If the user types in a letter that has already been guessed nothing will happen.

                            that the user can check to signify if it is completed or not. At the top of the website one
                            can find a search bar that will filter the todos based on what the user types in by looking for 
                            a matching title. The user will also be told how many todos are left based on how many unfinished 
                            (unchecked) todos exist.
                            There is also an option to only display the incompleted todos.
